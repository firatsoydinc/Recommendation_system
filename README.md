Content-Based Recommendation System with Real Dataset 

Pop-up libraries are a popular application that brings together those who want to share 
books and those who want to borrow books. Compared to real libraries; pop-up libraries are 
thought to be more accessible in terms of transportation and working hours. 

This research aims to analyze how can a context-aware recommendation system make books in pop-up 
libraries more accessible and develop a recommendation system in Utrecht. Within the scope of this research, 
a recommendation system on how to make the books in pop-up libraries more accessible was designed and tested 
in three iterations. In the developed recommendation system, the accuracy was 47% when the online data set was 
used, while it decreased to 14% when the real data set was used. According to the first findings from the 
final prototype; since the books in the pop-up libraries may be regional, they may not appeal to everyone. 
It has been observed that the location of some pop-up libraries in the business center in Utrecht limits users 
from reaching the library 24/7. The inadequacy of the book option in pop-up libraries is another limitation that 
emerged as a result of the research. It has been determined that the recommendation system becomes smarter when 
used with a data-driven approach.
